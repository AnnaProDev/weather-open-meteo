# Weather Open-Meteo

This web app was built to practice clean, beginner-friendly JavaScript and simple UI thinking. <br>
It shows current weather for any city using the free Open-Meteo APIs (no API key).

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Open-Meteo Geocoding API

## What's Inside?

Curious what the app can do? Here are the highlights:

### Now, Not Later

The app focuses on current conditions only — no clutter. Enter a city and see what it’s like right now.

### Three Tiny Tabs

Switch between Temperature, Conditions, and Wind.
Each click makes a fresh GET request so the data stays up to date.

### Simple City Search

Type a city name and the app uses Open-Meteo Geocoding to find the best match (name, country, lat/lon).

### Lightweight & Beginner-Friendly

No frameworks, no build step — just HTML/CSS/JS. The code is short, readable, and easy to tweak.
